\section{How-to guides}\label{sec:ambulance_game_how_to}

This section contains a series of how-to guides that explain how to use the
library.
This section contains four subsections that explain how to use the library
for the following purposes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Simulating the hospital using discrete event simulation.
    \item Getting the Markov chain representation of the hospital.
    \item Creating an object oriented implementation of the functionality of
    both the discrete event simulation and the Markov chain representation.
    \item Creating a game theoretic model of the hospital. 
\end{itemize}
