\chapter{Numerical Results}\label{sec:numerical_results}

This chapter presents the results of the numerical experiments conducted to
study the behavioural patterns that can emerge from the interaction between the
two EDs and the EMS.
This chapter consists of a \textit{Data Collection} section, which describes the
data collection process, and a \textit{What if scenarios} section, which
presents the results of the numerical experiments.
Note that the data presented in this chapter are archived and can be found
