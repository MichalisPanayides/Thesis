\chapter{Game theoretic model}\label{sec:game_theoretic_model}

Apart from the queueing theoretic model the second main outcome of this research
is the construction of a game theoretic model that uses the queueing model
described in Section~\ref{sec:queueing_section}.
This game theoretic framework consists of three players where these player in
Section~\ref{sec:game_ems_es_application} will represent the Emergency Medical
Services and two Emergency Departments.
The main purpose of this game theoretic model is to observe the behavioural
patterns that arise when the players are interacting with each other.
The game theoretic model aims to look into behavioural patterns that emerge
when the players are interacting with each other and act in such a way so that
they maximise their utility. 
This section has five subsections, Formulation, Methodology, ED-EMS application
and Results.
