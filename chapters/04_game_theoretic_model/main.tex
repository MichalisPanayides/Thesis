\chapter{Game theoretic model}\label{sec:game_theoretic_model}

Apart from the queueing theoretic model the second main outcome of this research
is the construction of a game theoretic model that uses the queueing model
described in Section~\ref{sec:queueing_section}.
This game theoretic framework consists of three players where these player in
Section~\ref{sec:game_ems_ed_application} will represent the Emergency Medical
Services and two Emergency Departments.
The main purpose of this game theoretic model is to observe the behavioural
patterns that arise when the players are interacting with each other.
The game theoretic model aims to look into behavioural patterns that emerge
when the players are interacting with each other and act in such a way so that
they maximise their utility. 
This chapter consists of four main sections:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Section~\ref{sec:game_theory_intro} gives a brief introduction to
    the game theoretic concepts
    \item Section~\ref{sec:game_formulation} describes the formulation of the
    game theoretic model that is used in this research
    \item Section~\ref{sec:game_methodology} describes the methodology that is
    used to solve the game theoretic model
    \item Section~\ref{sec:game_ems_ed_application} describes the application
    of the game theoretic model to the Emergency Medical Services and two
    Emergency Departments
\end{itemize}

This chapter extends the concepts described in~\cite{panayides2023game}.
