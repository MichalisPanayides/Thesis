\chapter{Queueing theoretic model}\label{sec:queueing_section}

One of the main outcomes of this research is the creation of a queueing network
model that consists of two queueing nodes and accepts two types of individuals.

    \caption{A diagrammatic representation of the queueing network.
    The threshold \(T\) only applies to type 2 individuals.
    If the number of individuals in node 1 is greater than or equal to
    \(T\), only individuals of type 1 are accepted (at a rate \(\lambda_1\))
    and individuals of type 2 (arriving at a rate \(\lambda_2\)) are blocked in
    node 2.}
    \label{fig:diagram_of_queueing_system}
\end{figure}

The model consists of two types of individuals; type 1 and type 2.
Type 1 individuals arrive instantly at node 1 and wait to receive their
service.
Type 2 individuals arrive at node 2 and wait there until they are
allowed to move to node 1.
They are allowed to proceed only when the number of
individuals in node 1 \textbf{and} in service is less than a
pre-determined threshold \(T\).
When the number of individuals is equal to or exceeds this threshold, all
type 2 individuals that arrive will stay \textit{blocked} in node 2
until the number of people in node 1 falls below \(T\).
This is shown diagrammatically in Figure~\ref{fig:diagram_of_queueing_system}.
The parameters of the described queueing model are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\lambda_i\): The arrival rate of type \(i\) individuals where
    \(i\in\{1, 2\}\)
    \item \(\mu\): The service rate for individuals receiving service at
    node 1
    \item \(C\): The number of servers
    \item \(T\): The threshold at which individuals of the second type are
    blocked
    \item \(N\): The capacity of node 1 (i.e \(N=C + 
    \text{(Queue capacity)}\))
    \item \(M\): The capacity of node 2
\end{itemize}

In Section~\ref{sec:queueing_ems_ed_application} this queueing network will be
used to model the emergent behaviour between
Emergency Departments (EDs) and the Emergency Medical Systems (EMS).
