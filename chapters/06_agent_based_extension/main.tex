\chapter{Extending to agent-based extension}

This chapter aims to explore an extension to the game described earlier.
The extension is based on the idea of an agent-based
model~\cite{de2014agent, fetta2012peter, knight2012modelling}.
What if the servers of the queueing system described in
Section~\ref{sec:queueing_section} could be treated as entities that could make
their own decisions?

The idea here is that servers could choose their own service rate based on
maximising their own utility.
This would mean that the servers would be able to choose their own speed at
which they serve customers while the system is running.
Such decisions could be based on a number of factors, such as minimising the
number of customers in the system, minimising the proportion of patients lost
to the system, maximising their own idle time and so on.

The previous chapters are based on the assumption that hospitals and ambulances
play a non-cooperative game and act in their own self-interest.
Although this might be true in some cases, insights from ethnographic
studies~\cite{allen2004understanding} have shown that some cooperation and
empathy can be found among staff in such gaming environment.
The motivation for this chapter was initiated by these insights.

This chapter is structured in such a way that the first section describes a
state-dependent version of the queueing system described in
Section~\ref{sec:queueing_section}, the second section describes
a server-dependent variant and the third section combines them together and
formulate a reinforcement learning algorithm that works on finding the best
policies for the servers so that they can maximise their own utility.
