\chapter{Agent-based extension}

% TODO: Reinforcement Learning or Heuristic?
This chapter aims to explore an extension to the game described earlier.
The extension is based on the idea of an agent-based model.

What if the servers of the queueing system described in
Section~\ref{sec:queueing_section} could be treated as entities that could make
their own decisions?

The idea here is that servers could choose their own service rate based on
maximising their own utility.
This would mean that the servers would be able to choose their own speed at
which they serve customers while the system is running.
Such decisions could be based on a number of factors, such as minimising the
number of customers in the system, minimising the proportion of patients lost
to the system, maximising their own idle time and so on.

This chapter is structured in such a way that the first section describes the
state-dependent version of the queueing system described in
Section~\ref{sec:queueing_section}, the second section describes the
a server-dependent variant and the third section combines them together and
formulate a reinforcement learning algorithm that works on finding the best
policies for the servers so that they can maximise their own utility.
