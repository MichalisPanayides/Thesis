\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

First of all I would like to express my sincerest and greatest gratitude to my
incredible supervisors, Dr. Vince Knight and Prof. Paul Harper whose guidance
and support helped me grow as a researcher and as a person.
Their tolerance, and great sense of humour, helped me through the ups and downs
that come with a PhD and I am very grateful for that.
I truly believe I could not have had a better pair of supervisors.
Thanks to the both of you.

I would also like to thank The Healthcare Improvement Studies Institute (THIS)
for funding this research and for providing me with this wonderful experience.
In particular I would like to thank the mentor I was assigned by THIS, Prof.
Sonya Crowe, for her advice and support.
Those couple of meetings were really helpful and valuable.
I would also like to thank Prof. Davina Allen for her comments and ethnographic
insights that she provided that helped guide my research.

On a more personal note I would like to thank my parents, Anastasia and
Panayiotis and my brother Stavros for their unconditional love and support
throughout my PhD.
A big thank you to my friends in Cardiff as well; my flatmates Nikolas and
Vasilis for all the PhD talk they had to endure; Athena for the countless
Thursday lunch breaks; and Panos for all the necessary board game nights.

I would also like to thank all of my academic buddies and in particular
Elizabeth Williams for her constant help with any random problem I had through
my PhD and for constantly looking out for my plant Trev; Matthew Howells for
never failing
to make the right pun and for the countless nerf gun battles we had; and
Michela Corradini for being the most annoying individual I ever met, and for
that one thing she helped me fix on Figure~\ref{fig:venn_diagram_with_subsets}
in page~\pageref{fig:venn_diagram_with_subsets} of this thesis and kept saying
I should include her in my acknowledgements for it.
Lastly, thank you to the School of Mathematics staff for maintaining the
friendly and supportive environment that I have enjoyed throughout my PhD.
